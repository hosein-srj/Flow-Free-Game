The game presents Numberlink puzzles: each puzzle has a grid of squares with colored dots occupying some of the squares. The objective is to connect dots of the same color by drawing 'pipes' between them such that the entire grid is occupied by pipes. However, pipes may not intersect. Difficulty is primarily determined by the size of the grid, ranging from 5x5 to 15x15 squares. The game also contains additional paid packs as well as a time trial mode. Whenever a level is completed, a check mark will appear on the level select icon to indicate that the puzzle is solved, while a star indicates that the player finished the puzzle with the fewest moves required.
